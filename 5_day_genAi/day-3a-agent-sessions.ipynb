Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic and exciting areas where AI is making significant inroads. Here are some of the new developments and key trends in AI-driven drug discovery:\n\n**1. Accelerating the Entire Pipeline:**\n\n*   **Target Identification:** AI is now being used to analyze vast amounts of genomic, proteomic, and clinical data to identify novel disease targets that might have been previously overlooked. This goes beyond known pathways to uncover complex interactions.\n*   **Molecule Design and Optimization (De Novo Drug Design):** This is a major area of progress. Instead of just screening existing libraries, AI models (often generative models like GANs or VAEs) are designing entirely new molecules with desired properties (e.g., binding affinity, solubility, low toxicity) from scratch.\n    *   **Example:** Companies are using AI to generate millions of potential drug candidates that can bind to a specific protein target, then using further AI to rank and select the most promising ones.\n*   **Predicting Drug Properties and Efficacy:** AI can predict how a drug candidate will behave in the body (pharmacokinetics - ADME: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) and its potential efficacy and toxicity *before* it's synthesized and tested in labs. This dramatically reduces the number of compounds that need to be physically tested.\n*   **Repurposing Existing Drugs:** AI can identify new therapeutic uses for drugs that are already approved or in development for other conditions, significantly shortening the path to market.\n\n**2. Novel Approaches and Technologies:**\n\n*   **AI for Protein Folding and Structure Prediction:** Tools like **AlphaFold** (from DeepMind/Google) have revolutionized our ability to predict the 3D structure of proteins. Knowing a protein's structure is crucial for designing drugs that can bind to it. This has opened up many new possibilities for targeting previously \"undruggable\" proteins.\n*   **AI in Biologics and Peptide Design:** Beyond small molecules, AI is also being applied to design complex biologics like antibodies, peptides, and even new protein-based therapeutics.\n*   **Synthetic Biology Integration:** AI is being combined with synthetic biology approaches to engineer microorganisms or cells to produce therapeutic compounds.\n*   **Quantum Computing in Drug Discovery:** While still in its early stages, the integration of quantum computing with AI holds immense potential for simulating molecular interactions with unprecedented accuracy, which could lead to breakthroughs in drug design.\n\n**3.

They perform a vast array of functions, from catalyzing biochemical reactions (enzymes) to transporting molecules and forming structural components. The way a protein works is intricately linked to its unique three-dimensional shape, or \"fold.\"\n\nFor decades, determining a protein's structure was an incredibly challenging, time-consuming, and expensive process, typically involving techniques like X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These methods require growing protein crystals or preparing samples in specific ways, and even then, success isn't guaranteed. Many proteins are difficult to crystallize or are too dynamic to capture a stable structure.\n\n**How AI, particularly AlphaFold, Changed the Game:**\n\n*   **Predicting Structure from Sequence:** The core breakthrough is that AI models like AlphaFold can predict a protein's 3D structure with remarkable accuracy, solely from its amino acid sequence (the linear string of building blocks that make up the protein).\n*   **Deep Learning Power:** AlphaFold uses a sophisticated deep learning architecture that analyzes evolutionary relationships between amino acid sequences and the spatial relationships between amino acids within the protein. It essentially learns the complex rules that govern how proteins fold.\n*   **Unprecedented Accuracy:** AlphaFold2, in particular, achieved accuracy levels comparable to experimental methods for many proteins. This was a massive leap forward.\n*   **Open Access and Massive Databases:** DeepMind, in collaboration with EMBL-EBI, made the predicted structures for millions of proteins publicly available. This created a treasure trove of structural information for researchers worldwide.\n\n**Impact on Drug Discovery:**\n\n1.  **Target Identification and Validation:**\n    *   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Many disease-causing proteins were considered \"undruggable\" because their structures were unknown or they lacked clear binding pockets for small molecules. Now, with predicted structures, researchers can identify potential binding sites and design drugs to interact with them.\n    *   **Understanding Disease Mechanisms:** Knowing the structure of disease-related proteins helps scientists understand how mutations or other factors lead to malfunction, providing crucial insights for drug development.\n\n2.  **Rational Drug Design:**\n    *   **Designing Ligands (Drugs):** With a protein's 3D structure in hand, computational chemists and AI algorithms can design molecules (ligands or drugs) that are specifically shaped to bind to critical sites on the protein. This is far more efficient than random screening.\n    *   **Optimizing Binding:** AI can help predict how modifications to a drug molecule will affect its binding affinity and specificity to the target protein.\n\n3.  **Antibody and Biologic Design:**\n    *   **Engineering Therapeutic Antibodies:** Understanding the structure of target proteins is essential for designing antibodies that can bind to them effectively to block their activity or flag them for destruction by the immune system.\n\n4.  **Accelerating Research:**\n    *   **Saving Time and Resources:** Researchers no longer have to spend months or years trying to determine the structure of a protein of interest. They can often access a highly accurate prediction almost instantly.\n    *   **Democratizing Structural Biology:** This technology makes advanced structural insights accessible to a much wider range of researchers, even those without extensive structural biology expertise or equipment.\n\n**In essence, AlphaFold and similar AI structure prediction tools have unlocked a new era in understanding protein biology. By providing accurate 3D blueprints for proteins, they are fundamentally changing how we approach the earliest stages of drug discovery, making it more precise, efficient, and capable of tackling previously intractable targets.**\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies involved in **AI for protein structure prediction and its application in drug discovery**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
